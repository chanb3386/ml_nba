To Do: update data function (selenium), everything.

Data collected: overall team stats, player-by-player team stats, home/away loss differential, recent team performance (W/L, performance
relative to the mean, game info, etc), TEAM MISC, recent opp record

neural network inputs: evaluation of net ratings, player matchup advantage, team matchup advantage, home advantage, recent performance bias

poisson for defensive/offensive play per minute of game time? (Pace, off rtg, def rtg, ppg, bpg...)
