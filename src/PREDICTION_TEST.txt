Interpretations:
According to Kevin Belhumeur from Bleacher Report, you can expect an average team during a 
season to win 60% of their home games (P[HOMEWIN] = .6). Assume this statistic is true.
If this is the case, then a team with greater than 60% odds to win a home indicates that
the team has a statistical advantage over the other team, excluding home game advantage.

ex:
	Blazers @ Jazz P[HOMEWIN] = .6876384
	The Jazz had a significantly higher probability than winning at home than average
	against the blazers. This was reflected in the real game (Jazz lead by as much as 20)

	Thunder @ Hornets P[HOMEWIN] = .5459862
	The Hornets are expected to win (likely as a result of homefield advantage)
	but their probability of winning at home against the Thunder is far below 
	the league average.

	Timberwolves @ Kings P[HOMEWIN] = .6209254
	This indicates that its pretty close, and there may be no significant advantage.
	This was reflected in the real game by a 1-point win by the Kings.

	Highest vs. Lowest Net Rating (Bucks vs Hawks as of 12/27)
	Bucks @ Hawks P[HOMEWIN] = .5437479
	Hawks @ Bucks P[HOMEWIN] = .7025835

	This doesn't look too bad, however it seems the model may over stress the importance
	of home field advantage. Even though the Bucks hold the Hawks to far below the 
	league average here, reasonably I would expect P[HOMEWIN] < .5 for this 
	specific game. 

Based on this, if P[HOMEWIN] > .6, it is a fair prediction to assume that the home team
has a clear cut advantage over the away team

If P[HOMEWIN] = .6, then the teams have equal advantage, with the exception of homefield

If P[HOMEWIN] < .5, then the away team has a clear skill/scoring advantage over the home team

Using .6 as the average for league home wins provides a clear indication of team advantage
